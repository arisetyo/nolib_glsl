# Basic Shader with GLSL

This folder contains basic examples of shaders written in GLSL without using any external libraries.

## Contents

- `index.html`: Where the magic happens.
- `main.js`: The magic itself
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

No libraries were used for the shaders. You just need to run Vite to start the localhost server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173/` (or other port if 5173 was not available).
